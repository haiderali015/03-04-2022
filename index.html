    <h1>
        GIT INIT command
    </h1>
    <p>
        The git init command is the first command that you will run on Git. The git init command is used to create a new blank repository. 
        It is used to make an existing project as a Git project. Several Git commands run inside the repository, but init command can be run 
        outside of the repository.

    <h1>
        GIT ADD command
    </h1>
    <p>
        The git add command adds new or changed files in your working directory to the Git staging area. git add is an important command - without it, 
        no git commit would ever do anything. Sometimes, git add can have a reputation for being an unnecessary step in development.

    <h1>
        GIT COMMIT command
    </h1>
    <p>
        The git commit command will save all staged changes, along with a brief description from the user, in a “commit” to the local repository. 
        Commits are at the heart of Git usage. You can think of a commit as a snapshot of your project, where a new version of that project is created 
        in the current repository.
